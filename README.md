# Bot UI
---

## Overview

This project is a simple chat application featuring:

- **Frontend:** Built with React, allowing users to send messages.
- **Backend API:** Handles incoming messages and echoes them back to the frontend.

The frontend provides the user interface for message input, while the backend API processes and responds with the same message.
